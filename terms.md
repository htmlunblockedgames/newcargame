# PolyTrack Terms of Service

Last updated: 2026-02-17

## 1\. Introduction

Welcome to PolyTrack! These Terms of Service explain the rules and guidelines for playing the game. By playing PolyTrack, players agree to abide by these Terms.

## 2\. Acceptable Use

Players must use the game in a manner that is respectful to others and does not disrupt the gaming experience. Prohibited behaviors include, but are not limited to:

* Using offensive or inappropriate nicknames or car designs.
* Submitting fraudulent or manipulated leaderboard records. This includes using unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage.
* Distributing tracks which contain abusive, offensive, inappropriate or copyrighted content without permission.
* Using automated tools or scripts to interact with the server API (vps.kodub.com) in a way that negatively impacts server performance or other players' experiences.

## 3\. Enforcement

Violations of these Terms may result in penalties, including but not limited to:

* Removal of leaderboard entries.
* Censored nicknames or car designs.
* IP address blocking.

## 4\. Mods and Reuploads

This section applies to any modifications (mods) made to PolyTrack or reuploads of the game for the purpose of unblocking on restricted networks.

Mods and reuploads are subject to the following conditions:

* Non-commercial Use: The mod or reupload must be made available completely non-commercially, including without limitation: no in-game advertising, no website advertising, no sponsorships, no paid access, and no other direct or indirect monetization.
* Attribution: The mod or reupload must clearly attribute the original game to Kodub.com. A clear, clickable link to the official game page at CrazyGames (https://www.crazygames.com/game/polytrack) must also be provided.
* Unofficial Notice: The mod or reupload must clearly state that it is an unofficial version and not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Kodub.com, CrazyGames, Poki or itch.io.
* Outbound Links: Outbound links from the game should not be changed or removed. The link to kodub.com in the menu must remain intact.
* In-game Notice: For reuploads, the automatic in-game notice when running on an unrecognized domain must remain intact and unaltered. For a mod, the color can be changed and this alternative text can be used instead: _"Unofficial <MOD NAME> mod by <AUTHOR>. For the original version please visit: <URL>"_
* Domain Name: The mod or reupload must not be distributed from a domain name that includes "kodub", "polytrack", "crazygames", "poki" or any confusingly similar variations which may lead players to believe it is the official site.
* Competition: Mods or reuploads must not be distributed on platforms that directly compete with Kodub.com, CrazyGames or Poki.
* Search / Discoverability: The mod or reupload must not be optimized for search engines or compete for discoverability on search engines with the official game pages on Kodub.com, CrazyGames, Poki or itch.io.
* No Inappropriate Content: The mod, reupload or embedding website must not contain any content that is illegal, offensive, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate.
* Right to Remove: Kodub.com and CrazyGames reserve the right to request the removal of any mod or reupload that does not comply with these Terms or that it deems inappropriate for any reason.

## 5\. No Warranties

PolyTrack and related services are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Kodub.com disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, accuracy, availability, security, and non-infringement. No representation is made that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free from defects, viruses, or other harmful components. To report an issue, please get in touch at [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#640d0a020b240f0b0011064a070b09) or any of the other contact methods listed on the contact page at [https://www.kodub.com/contact](/contact).

## 6\. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Kodub.com will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages (including lost profits, loss of data, or loss of goodwill) arising from use of the game, website or related services.

Kodub.com will not provide compensation for any losses (including but not limited to direct losses or indirect losses) except where required by mandatory applicable law. Where compensation is required by law, Kodub.com's aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms is limited to one hundred euros (EUR 100).

For these purposes, "direct losses" means provable out-of-pocket costs caused directly by a material breach of these Terms; indirect or consequential losses are excluded. These Terms do not affect rights that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law.

## 7\. Changes to These Terms

When these Terms are updated, the revised version will be posted here and the "Last updated" date will be updated accordingly. The revised Terms will take effect 14 days after posting; during that 14-day period, the previous Terms will continue to apply. Continuing to access PolyTrack after the 14-day period indicates acceptance of the updated Terms.
